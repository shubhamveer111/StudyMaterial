* In terrform there is 8 to 10 blocks.
1. Provider 2. Resource 3. Data

*  We can use "variable.tf" file if we want to assign variable instend of value.
*  If we want to check what we done in teraaform we can use "Output.tf" file so it will dispaly what we want.
*  If we want multiple resouce work on same terrform file so that terraform.tfstate file may conflict there so for that we can use "Backend.tf"
   file where we can add tfstate file into s3 bucket.

* If we want to use exiting resorce which we have alredy created in AWS like "AWS Key" for that we can use "Data" block.
